# Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem - CS 201, Fall 2017 Homework Assignment 2
 
In this assignment,I analyze and compare algorithmic complexity of four different solutions for the Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem.
 
Following code segment is used to compute the execution time of a code block.

 
       // Store the starting time
       double duration;
       clock_t startTime = clock();
       // Code block
       // ...
       //Compute the number of milliseconds that passed since the starting time duration = 1000 * double( clock() - startTime ) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
       cout << "Execution took " << duration << " milliseconds." << endl;
